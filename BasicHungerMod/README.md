## Basic Hunger Mod

A mod for Primiter that acts as a rudimentary hunger/fatigue system.

Slowly over time you will lose max HP to a minimum of 500.
Eating food will raise your max HP up to 2000.

Requires [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)

Your HP decay will be very slow so no need to worry about starvation. This mod acts more as a incentive to start making large wheat farms or slime ranches to get high health bonuses.

If you die however you health will be reset back to 1000. Your health will persist with your save even if you uninstall the mod. If you want to reset your health to default, save after dying.
